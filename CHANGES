== 1.3.3 - 21-Jun-2010
* Bug fixes for JRuby on MS Windows. The code now explicitly checks for JRuby
  in a few places to ensure it doesn't try to load unsupported libraries
  on MS Windows. Thanks go to Rob Schultz for the spot and some patches.
* The Net::Ping::HTTP class will no longer fail because a root URI
  is missing a trailing slash. If the URI#path is empty, it now defaults
  to the root path.
* The Rakefile tasks and naming were refactored.
* Some tests were refactored to take advantage of test-unit 2.x features,
  as well as make them better and more descriptive in general.

== 1.3.2 - 21-Sep-2009
* Doing a 'require "net/ping"' was not automatically loading the
  Net::Ping::WMI class on MS Windows. This has been fixed. Thanks go to
  Joseph M. for the spot. 
* Removed all $LOAD_PATH mangling for both the library and tests.
* Fixed a bug in the Net::Ping::HTTP class where a failed redirect did
  not set the @exception and @warning instance variables properly.
* The PingStatus struct returned by Net::Ping::WMI is now frozen.
* The test-unit library was switched from a runtime dependency to a
  development dependency.
* Added the :gem Rake task that builds a gem.
* Updated the :gem_install task to use the :gem task as a prerequisite.
* Updated the dependencies for MS Windows.
* The Rake test tasks are now more Rakish, e.g. test:tcp instead of test_tcp.
* Renamed example file names to avoid any potential confusion with actual
  test files.

== 1.3.1 - 22-Jul-2009
* Removed class aliases, e.g. use Ping::External, not PingExternal.
* Minor code change to eliminate a warning that popped up in 1.9.x.
* The win32-open3 library is removed as a dependency for Ruby 1.9.x.
* Changed license to Artistic 2.0.
* Some gemspec and README updates.

== 1.3.0 - 19-May-2009
* Added the Ping::WMI class for MS Windows. This class encapsulates the
  Win32_PingStatus WMI class. Unlike other ping methods, this one returns
  a struct that contains various bits of information.
* The Net::Ping::External class now ensures that handles opened by the open3
  call are closed. Thanks go to Nick S. Kanakakorn for the spot and a
  preliminary patch.
* The Net::Ping::ICMP class now explicitly closes the socket if the call to
  the Socket.pack_sockaddr_in method fails.
* Some documentation updates.

== 1.2.3 - 13-Jan-2008
* Fixed a bug in the checksum private method where it would die on odd data
  sizes. Thanks go to Jake Douglas for the spot.
* A Socket.get_sockaddr_in call in the Ping::ICMP class is no longer included
  as part of the overall ping time. Thanks go again to Jake Douglas for
  the spot.
* Added data_size tests to the Ping::ICMP test suite.
* Renamed and updated the test files. The test-unit 2.x gem is now a
  prerequisite as a result.

== 1.2.2 - 22-Jan-2008
* Bug fix for Ping::External where it was not honoring the timeout value.
  Thanks go to Chris Morris for the spot and the patch.
* Bug fix for Ping::External where non-English output could cause false
  positives on MS Windows Vista or later. This library now requires the
  windows-pr library on MS Windows systems as a result.
* Added the Ping::UDP.service_check and Ping::UDP.service_check= class
  methods. This method controls whether or not Errno::ECONNREFUSED or
  Errno::ECONNRESET are considered successful pings or not.
* The Ping::HTTP class no longer uses the resolv-replace library on MS Windows
  because it was (ironically) causing timeouts.
* Changed the Ping::TCP.econnrefused method to Ping::TCP.service_check. I
  changed it because I now use a similar method in Ping::UDP, but that handles
  more than Errno::ECONNREFUSED. An alias is provided to provide backwards
  compatibility, but it is considered deprecated and will be removed in the
  1.3.0 release.
* Removed the install.rb file. The Rakefile now handles installation.

== 1.2.1 - 6-Apr-2007
* For the Ping::External class, if a ping attempt results in 100% packet loss
  it is now considered a failed ping, regardless of whether or not an error
  was sent to stdout.
* Fixed the Ping::External class for OS X.
* Added a Rakefile. Installation and testing should now be run via Rake tasks.
* Minor fix for the Ping::ICMP class where I had accidentally dup'd some
  aliases. This was harmless, but did cause warnings with -w.

== 1.2.0 - 5-Dec-2006
* Internal reorganization - each class now lives in its own file.
* Added the Ping::ICMP class.  Thanks go to Jos Backus for contributing a 
  large part of the code.
* The host argument is now optional in the constructor.  You can now specify
  it in the ping method instead.  Note that it must be specified in one place
  or the other.
* Each PingXXX class is now Ping::XXX instead.  However, class name aliases
  have been setup for backwards compatibility for now.
* The constructor for each Ping types now yields self.
* Added the pingecho alias for the ping method for each Ping type.
* Added the Ping::HTTP#follow_redirect accessor.
* The Ping::HTTP#ping method now honors the timeout value.
* The Ping::HTTP class now follows redirects automatically, though this is
  configurable with the follow_redirect accessor.
* The Ping::TCP.ecr and Ping::TCP.ecr= methods are now true class method
  aliases (they were just wrappers previously).
* The Ping::UDP class now enforces a 64 character limit on data that can be
  sent on a udp ping.
* Updated the gemspec.  Specifically, MS Windows now has a dependency on
  the win32-open3 package.
* Added inline rdoc.

== 1.1.1 - 15-Jun-2006
* Fixed a bug in PingTCP (bad variable name).  Thanks go to Anoop Chandran
  for the spot.
* Minor variable name refactoring.
* Minor test updates.

== 1.1.0 - 17-Jul-2005
* Fixed a bug in the PingHTTP#ping method where I was accidentally passing
  the timeout value instead of the port number as the third argument to
  Net::HTTP.get_response.
* The PingHTTP.new method now has a default port of 80.
* Minor doc update for PingHTTP.new.

== 1.0.1 - 22-Jun-2005
* Bug fix for the install.rb file.  The gem is unaffected.

== 1.0.0 - 14-Jun-2005
* Renamed project from net-pingsimple to just net-ping.
* Added a PingHTTP subclass.
* Moved project to RubyForge.
* Added a gemspec.

== 0.3.1 - 9-Apr-2005
* Updated PingExternal to use win32/open3 on Win32 platforms.
* Minor error handling change for the PingSimple.econnrefused= method.  It now
  raises an ArgumentError if any values other than true or false are passed.
* PingSimple#warning and PingSimple#exception are now read-only methods.
* The warning and exception attributes are now reset to nil between each call
  to ping.
* The data and data= methods are now unique to the PingUDP class.
* The time and time= methods have been changed to timeout and timeout=,
  respectively.
* Removed the pingsimple.rd and pingsimple.html files.  The pingsimple.txt file
  has been reorganized and is now rdoc friendly.
* Added a few sample programs under the 'examples' directory.
* Some minor test updates and changes.
* Removed the INSTALL file.  That information is now in the README file.
* Now requires Ruby 1.8.0 or later.

== 0.3.0 - 12-Feb-2004
* Fixed ping string for PingExternal class based on platform.  The old
  string was really only good for Linux and *BSD.
* Added Win32 support (requires win32_popen package).
* Added warranty info.

== 0.2.3 - 12-Aug-2003
* Fixed a bug in PingExternal that could consume file descriptors if used in a loop
* Added some initialization to avoid -w warnings
* Removed VERSION() class method.  Use the constant instead
* Modified test suite slightly
* Moved rd2 docs to doc directory

== 0.2.2 - 3-Apr-2003
* Fixed handling of stdout in PingExternal

== 0.2.1 - 27-Mar-2003

* Exceptions and warnings from PingExternal are now chomp'd
* Modified test suite
* Doc updates

== 0.2.0 - 14-Feb-2003
* The default behavior of PingTCP with regards to ECONNREFUSED is now 
  configurable
* Added a VERSION constant and method (to the base class)
* Added a test suite (for those with testunit installed)
* Doc changes, rearrangement and general cleanup
* Manifest is now MANIFEST
* Added an INSTALL file

== 0.1.0 - 9-Dec-2002
* Added ping? alias for ping method
* Warnings now handled separately
* Corrected a mis-named variable in Ping::External
* Fixed the install.rb file
* Updated and added docs
* Renamed tarball to net-pingsimple to reflect RAA naming convention
